## Instructions

To start the game just select the first two cards. This will start the timer. The game will evaluate the two selections for a match. If they match then the cards will turn green and stay turned over. If there is no match then the cards will turn red and turn back over. The more cards that are selected without a match will subtract a star rating. Once all cards are matched then you will get a Congratulations screen with your star rating, time and how many moves it took. You can then select the Play Again to start another game. You can also select the circular arrow at the top to reset the game and start over from the beginning.
